Flow chart/Algorithm

How to write script to install python or git :

1. which user sudo or normal?
2. If normal user throw error
3. if admin sudo access is there then we need to proceed for installation
4. proceed with installation
5. if any error occurs in installation we need to tell user, otherwise we can proceed

git advantages:
who did the code
when did they write the code 
we can go back to previous version without much hassle 
branching
master --> sub_sai branch --> PR --> merge --> master update
create a branch make changes if all good we merge the code to master/main
collabaration
backup and security (key pairs authentication)

GIT is popular now and decentralized version control system


Decentralized (Distribution) vs Centralised

git repository means it will store code

repository --> just like a folder it will save some code with some features mentioned above

before we send code to repo we need authentication

Git push 
username/password --> every time we need to give
username/key --> it will be one time and secured

1. first level of security
username/password
if stolen it is a problem

2. secondlevel authentication key
RSA tokens (30 second)
MS authenticator (30 second)

first  --> public key ()
second --> private key ()

github --> public key
laptop --> private key

data is transefered only when we have private key with us

github --> public key server
password --> private key with user
place public key in server and keep private key with you

3. third level of security
finger prints, palm, face unlock (physical presence)
public key in server (here in github)
private key is with you (in our laptop)


What is a key pair
public and private keys

how to generate a key pair for SSH
SSH --> secured shell
ssh-keygen -f <filename>

HTTPS --> https://github.com/praveenkumarilla4git/Sai_folder.git (username and password)
SSH: --> git@github.com:praveenkumarilla4git/Sai_folder.git --> ssh key (public and private key)
